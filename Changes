Revision history for App-Pocoirc

{{$NEXT}}

0.44  Sun May 22 16:12:13 GMT 2011
    - Don't hang under --interactive if an exception is raised on startup

0.43  Thu May 19 15:40:10 GMT 2011
    - Fix the interactive help message, it implied that commas weren't
      needed in lists
    - ReadLine.pm: Only restore stdio when we have been unregistered from
      all IRC components
    - The network name in the ReadLine UI wasn't getting updated when
      running without a configuration file

0.42  Thu Apr 28 22:45:16 GMT 2011
    - Fix the same exec() problem as in the previous release, this time under
      --daemonize, because we were closing STDOUT/STDERR before redirecting
      them, which is not good.

0.41  Thu Apr 28 21:32:16 GMT 2011
    - Log it if we fail to log in due to a bad nickname
    - Decode any IRC strings before printing them under --trace
    - Enabling 'verbose' in --interactive after startup wasn't working
    - Fix output encoding in a few spots
    - POE::Wheel::Run with an exec()'d child was failing under --interactive

0.40  Wed Apr 27 05:50:35 GMT 2011
    - Oops. Didn't avoid custom stringification everywhere. Fixed.
    - Allow command-line option bundling, e.g. -itv instead of -i -t -v

0.39  Wed Apr 27 03:32:46 GMT 2011
    - Fix missing name for numeric 001 under --trace. Also depend on
      IRC::Utils 0.07 for even more numeric names.
    - Avoid custom stringifications when dumping objects with --trace

0.38  Tue Apr 26 22:03:37 GMT 2011
    - Replace status callbacks with irc_plugin_status events
    - Send an irc_network event when the network name changes
    - Enabling tracing in --interactive after startup wasn't working

0.37  Mon Apr 25 23:59:48 GMT 2011
    - Preserve symlinks in all supplied filenames
    - When using --trace, print the name (e.g. ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE) of every
      numberic event
    - Rename -i/--ircname to -r/--realname
    - Quit messages were not getting delivered to IRC servers. Fixed.
    - Add -i/--interactive which allows the user to call methods from
      the command line. Depend on POE 1.310 and POE::Component::IRC 6.61
      for related bugfixes, as well as Data::Dump for dumping return
      values of method calls.

0.36  Sat Apr 2 01:36:16 GMT 2011
    - Fix -V/--version, it was always returning "dev-git"

0.35  Sat Apr 2 00:22:39 GMT 2011
    - Allow using a short name (e.g. Qnet::State) with --class
    - Fix error in documentation about the default component class

0.34  Fri Dec 3 06:51:23 GMT 2010
    - Convert library directories (--lib) into absolute paths, so they'll still
      work after daemonization (which implies chdir()ing)
    - Use Class::Load instead of C<eval "require $class">. Safer on Perl <5.10.

0.33  Wed Nov 3 02:06:44 GMT 2010
    - Rely on POE::Component::IRC 6.50's shutdown code instead of handling it
      ourselves
    - Include irc_raw_out events in verbose output

0.32  Sun Oct 31 17:47:21 GMT 2010
    - Redirect STDOUT/STDERR to the log file (if any) when daemonized
    - Allow log_file and pid_file to be relative paths when daemonizing

0.31  Wed Oct 20 00:35:29 GMT 2010
    - When using --trace, don't put quotes around stringified references
      to objects
    - Print a usage message when unrecognized non-options are passed
    - Improve the output of --trace by recursively dumping hashes/arrays
    - Call bsd_glob() on filenames before opening them, so we understand
      paths like '~/log_file'
    - Allow .yaml as an extension, not just .yml

0.30  Mon Oct 18 21:03:18 GMT 2010
    - Only load Module::Pluggable when we need it (for --list-plugins)
    - Only load Pod::Usage when we need it (with an invalid option)
    - Delay the loading of App::Pocoirc until we need it
    - Add the -F/--pid-file option to the usage message
    - Use a comma instead of a colon to separate the channel name and
      password with the --join option, since commas are not allowed in
      channel names, whereas some networks allow colons.

0.29  Sun Oct 3 19:53:28 GMT 2010
    - Document the 'class' config file option
    - Allow the 'lib' config option to be a string or an array of strings

    - Format the verbose output like other debugging output
    - Don't raise an exception when someone parts without a part message
    - Convert to utf8 and strip all colors/formatting from IRC messages
      before they end up in the status log
    - Log it if we can't log into an IRC server due to the nick being in use

    - Don't print raw protocol lines simply because some plugin happens to
      enable raw events in POE::Component::IRC
    - Install INT signal handler after we load POE::Component::IRC, not
