=head1 NAME

App::Pocoirc - A command line tool for launching POE::Component::IRC clients

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution provides a generic way to launch IRC clients which use
L<POE::Component::IRC|POE::Component::IRC>. The main features are:

=over 4

=item * Prints useful status information (to your terminal and/or a log file)

=item * Will daemonize if you so wish

=item * Supports a configuration file

=item * Offers a user friendly way to pass arguments to POE::Component::IRC

=item * Supports multiple IRC components and lets you specify which plugins
to load locally (one object per component) or globally (single object)

=item * Has an interactive mode where you can issue issue commands and
call methods on the IRC component(s).

It can be used to launch IRC bots or proxies, loaded with plugins of your
choice. It is very useful for testing and debugging
L<POE::Component::IRC|POE::Component::IRC> plugins as well as IRC servers.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

 nick:     foobar1234
 username: foobar
 log_file: /my/log.file
 lib:      /my/modules

 global_plugins:
   - [CTCP]

 local_plugins:
   - [BotTraffic]

 networks:
   freenode:
     server: irc.freenode.net
     local_plugins:
       - [AutoJoin, { Channels: ['#foodsfdsf'] } ]
   magnet:
     server: irc.perl.org
     nick:   hlagherf32fr

The configuration file is in L<YAML|YAML> or L<JSON|JSON> format. It consists
of a hash containing C<global_plugins>, C<local_plugins>, C<networks>, C<lib>,
C<log_file>, C<class>, and default parameters to
L<POE::Component::IRC|POE::Component::IRC/spawn>. Only C<networks> is
required.

C<lib> is either the name of a directory containing Perl modules (e.g.
plugins), or an array of such names. Kind of like Perl's I<-I>.

C<log_file> is the path to a log file to which status messages will be written.

C<class> is the IRC component class. Defaults to
L<POE::Component::IRC::State|POE::Component::IRC::State>.

=head2 Networks

The C<networks> option should be hash of network hashes. The keys are the
names of the networks. A network hash can contain C<local_plugins> and
parameters to POE::Component::IRC. None are required, except C<server> if not
defined at the top level. The POE::Component::IRC parameters specified in this
hash will override the ones specified at the top level.

=head2 Plugins

The C<global_plugins> and C<local_plugins> options should consist of an array
containing the short plugin class name (e.g. 'AutoJoin') and optionally a hash
of arguments to that plugin. When figuring out the correct package name,
App::Pocoirc will first try to load POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::I<YourPlugin>
before trying to load I<YourPlugin>.

The plugins in C<global_plugins> will be instantiated once and then added to
all IRC components. B<Note:> not all plugins are designed to be used with
multiple IRC components simultaneously.

If you specify C<local_plugins> at the top level, it will serve as a default
list of local plugins, which can be overridden in a network hash.
